# Minimax-Risk-Classifiers
This repository contains the code that I wrote for the experimental part of my Master's Degree thesis: "Cost-Sensitive Binary Minimax Risk Classifiers: a  theoretical lower bound for the performance and  application to the medical field". The work of research is the result of an internship period at the Basque Center of Applied Mathematics (Bilbao, Spain) under the supervision of Dr. Mazuelas.
